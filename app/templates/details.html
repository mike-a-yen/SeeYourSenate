	  <h4>Description of data</h4>
	</div>
	<p>The U.S. Senate votes on several hundred bills each year. All of the
	  data used by SYS is publicly available and free to download. You can
	  download the voting record of each congressional session all the way
	  back to the first congress. Most of the data used by SYS to make
	  predictions is based off of the title, main subject, and textual
	  content of each bill. Our database contains the voting record of each
	  senator going back to the 103rd congress, which served in 1993 and
	  1994.

	<p>What makes SYS's bill predictions accurate is the leverage gained by
	  modeling each senator individually. By aggregating these individual
	  models into one super model we are able to boost our prediction
	  accuracy by almost 10%, making our pass/fail predictions over 80%
	  accurate. The math behind this boost is the same as ensemble machine
	  learning methods.</p>
	<p>Each senator has a predictive model that is based on his or her own
	  voting record. The predictions made by each model are influenced by
	  the senator's voting record on bills with similar subject and content.
