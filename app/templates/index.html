      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>SYS has built a model that predicts the probability of a bill
	passing through the United States senate. We model the voting behavior of each
	senator from the text contained inside the bill, and with this
	information determine the probability of the bill being passed into
	law. Preliminary evidence has shown that SYS can predict the
	outcome of each bill with 80% accuracy. That is 8 out of 10 times SYS
	correctly determines if the bill passes or fails.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, we also summarize the voting
	behavior of individual senators, so you can get an idea
	about what your representative is voting for. This information
	can be used to see if your representative is likely to vote
	for bills you care about. Check out the
	<a href="/senator">Senator</a>
	page for more details.</p>
      
      <h4>Preliminary Analysis</h4>
      <p>The following analysis was done by studying the voting habits of
	  Senator Barbara Boxer (CA-D) over the last 16 years. In total, she
	participated in over 5,000 votes, with an approximately 50-50 split between
	"Yay" and "Nay" votes. By vectorizing the text in the headers of each
	bill, I was able to build a model that predicted Boxer's voting behavior
	with 70% accuracy, which is an improvement over random guessing.
	If I build a similar model for all other senators, retaining the 70%
	accuracy, I will be able to correctly predict wether or not a bill will
	pass the senate with an accuracy of 80%.

      <p>Bills are clustered together by use of similar vocabulary.
	Bills that mention similar things are grouped together. For
	example, bills that
	mention education are in a different group than bills that mention
	terrorism. The body of text used to identify each bill was taken from
	the each bill's title. This could be improved if the body of each bill
	was used rather than just the title.
	<br>
	Large dots are "Yay" votes and smaller dots are "Nay" votes,
	and from this visualization you can see Boxer has a tendency to vote
	"Yay" for all bills in some clusters and "Nay" for bills in other
	clusters.</p>
      <p>
	The fact that Boxer has a pattern of voting for or against bills with
	certain content, allows for a model to be built to predict her voting behavior.

      <p><small>This model will correctly predict the
      "pass" or "no pass" outcome with 80% accuracy.</small></p>
      <p>The voting behavior of the senate as a whole can be predicted by the
	voting behavior of individual senators. This representation can be
	more accurate than random if the individual predictive models for each
	senator are more accurate than 50%. This increased accuracy allows better predictions to be made on
	the outcomes of individual bills. 
	Building 100 individual
	models that can predict the voting behavior of each
	senator with an accuracy of 70% or greater, will correctly determine
	whether or not the bill passes with an accuracy of at least 80%. 
      </p>
      <p> This means when fully built, this model will correctly predict the
      "pass" or "no pass" outcome of future laws with an accuracy of 80%.
